# Project Workflow Using Arsenal Package

The arsenal package is a set of helpful utility functions focused on streamlining
data science projects in the real world (as opposed to academic research).

The package focuses on these main areas that tend to create the most issues
in data driven projects in an enterprise environment:

1. Raw Data Processing
2. Project and Time Management
3. Reproducible Analysis and Portability of Projects
